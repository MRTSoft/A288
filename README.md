# Project A288
A Project for Infomatrix contest 2015 by Marcu Tudor

## Description
Project A288 (or just A288) is a windows program that allows a person to create and to practice a test with multiple answers. The program has two main components.

This program is especially useful for students that prepare themselves for university admittance exams.

The first is a form for creating a quiz. We support multiple ways of creating it: writing the questions one by one, loading them from an XML file (or appending multiple quizzes) or even reading the question from a TXT file that follows a simple pattern (especially useful for entering a large amount of questions).

The second component is a form for practicing a quiz. The program supports timed quizzes and shuffles both the questions and the answers. After submitting the questions the user can see a detailed report of what he/she has done.
